## Usage
<br>1- Extract the file from the rar. </br>
<br>2- Before running the application, create a database suitable for the application with postgresql.</br>
<br>3- The database is not shared for privacy reasons. I can help you if you contact me.</br>
<br>4- Click on MuayeneSistemiUygulamasi.sln for the program to run.</br>
<br>5- After following the instructions above, the program screen will appear.</br>
<br>6- All required rules and criteria were followed in the application. Original code was tried to be written so that the assignment would not be similar to other assignments.</br> 
<br>7- I tried to be careful in the use of Turkish characters in the writing of the program.</br>
<br>8- However, having Turkish characters in the file content does not pose a problem.</br>

<br><h2>Sample run </h2></br>
<br>Extract the file from the rar</br>
<br>Open the file</br>
<br>Run MuayeneSistemiUygulamasi.sln in the file directory.</br>
